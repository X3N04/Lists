# Lists
Homebrewed Linked List Library. The STL list uses a doubly-linked list, so I made something similar but with a singly-linked list instead.<br>
Now includes a homebrewed BigInt Libry for some basic arithmetic unsigned big ints. No division just yet.
This is for education purposes only so if you really need one, use a FOSS library.
